# thakur22429s's First CS193 Homework

- CS193 is a reallyu helpful class as it connects better because of the fact that it is run by the USB 
- The class atmosphere is always comfortable and interactive
- The instructors focus on clearing doubts and queries rather than lecturing textbook concepts


 _**Some gibberish code to cheer you up**_

```c++
void KeepCalmAndCode()
{
   int c;
   c++; 
}

class task()
 {
     public:
     void getCoffeeAndCode(){ cout<<"\n Feeling Better! :-) ";}
 };
  
 void main()
 {
    bool isBored = false;
    
    cout<<"\n How are you feeling? ";
    cin>>isBored;
    
    if(isBored)
    {
        task t1 = t1.getCoffeeAndCode();
        isBored = false;
    }
    
    else
    {
        while(!isBored)
        KeepCalmAndCode();
    }
 }```
