# HELLO WORLD!

First time here at **GitHub**. _Markdown_ is really fun to use. 

`#include<fun.h>`
`#include<cs_is_awesome.h>`
 
`using namespace std;`
 
`class task()`
`{`
    `public:
      void getCoffeeAndCode(){ cout<<"\n Feeling Better! :-) ";}
 };`
  
`void main()
 {
    bool isBored = false;
    
    cout<<"\n How are you feeling? ";
    cin>>isBored;
    
    if(isBored)
    {
        task t1 = t1.getCoffeeAndCode();
        isBored = false;
    }
    
    else
    {
        while(!isBored)
        KeepCalmAndCode();
    }
    
  }`



## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
